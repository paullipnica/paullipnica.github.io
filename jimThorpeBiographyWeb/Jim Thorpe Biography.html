            <h2 id="EarlyLife">Early Life</h2>
                <p>
                    Jim Thorpe was born May 28, 1888 South of Bellemont Pottawatomie County - by the banks of the North Fork River. 
                    Although, many speculated where and when he was born, Thorpe later confirmed that the former is true. Thorpe's parents 
                    were both of mixed ancestry. Thorpe's father, Hiram Thorpe is of both Irish and Native Indian descent while his mother,
                    Charlotte Vieux is of both French and Native Indian descent (Wikimedia Foundation, 2024).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jim Thorpe attended the Sac and Fox Indian Agency school in Stroud,alongside his fraternal twin Charlie. 
                    Charlie was a pivotal part of Jim Thorpes early age as he helped him through school, unfortunatly passing away to pneumonia at the age of 9. This caused a few episodes of Jim running away from school.
                    As a result his father sent him another school, Haskell Institute, a Native Indian boarding school in Kansas, as a way to cope from him running away again. Him Thorpe's mother would die two years later of childbirth complications, 
                    which left Jim Thorpe depressed. After a few arguments with his father, Jim would leave home to work on a horse ranch (Wikimedia Foundation, 2024).
                </p>
                <p>   
                    In 1904, Jim Thorpe now sixteen years old, returned to his father and decided to attend Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania. 
                    His athletic ability was in full display and he was coached by Glenn Scobey "Pop" Warner, one of the most influential coaches of early American football history.
                    Hiram Thorpe, Jim's father would die that same year due to gangrene poisoning from a hunting incident. 
                    This led to Jim Thorpe to drop out of school again, resuming farm work for a few years before returning to Carlisle School (Jim Thorpe Biography, 2020).

            <h2 id="ProfessionalCareer">Professional Career</h2>
            <h3>Baseball</h3>
                <p>
                    Thorpe signed with the defending champions, the New York Giants baseball club in 1913. Thorpe played 19 of their 151 games and they would go on to repeat as Champions. Thorpe would then join the Chicago White Sox after losing the following season, going on world tours wit the team across United states. Thorpe would be the last man to compete in Baseball and in the Olympics. Thorpe played as an outfielder for three seasons. He would have a short stint playing in the minor leagues with Milwaukee Brewers in 1916 before returning to the big leagues with the Giants the following year. He was then traded/sold to the Cincinnati Reds before being sold back to the Giants again. He also was traded to the Boston Braves before moving onto his final team, the Toledo Mud Hens of the minor league (Jim Thorpe Olympics Fandom, 2024).
                </p>
                

            <h3>Football</h3>
                <p>
                    Thorpe first played professional football in 1913 and competed with Pine Village Pros of Indiana. He then signed with Canton Bulldogs in 1915 where they paid him $250 a game, a large sum at the time. Thorpe would increase the amount of fans in the game from 1200 to 8000 average most notably in his debut against Massillon Tigers. The team won titles in 1916, 1917 and 1919. Thorpe would kick a 95-yard punt from his own teams 5 yard line to win the final game in 1919 - an incredible feat even in today's era. The NFL was then formed during 1920 in which Thorpe became the first commissioner/president of. He played with Canton for the majority of his career where he then retired at the age of 41. Unfortunately statistics were not recorded during Thorpes time playing football (Jim Thorpe Olympics Fandom, 2024).
                </p>
            <h3>Basketball</h3>
                <p>
                    Although never documented and recorded, Thorpe did compete in Basketball for a brief stint where recent biographers found hints of him playing professionally. No statistics or records of games were found but there was a general agreement that Thorpe would have faired well in this sport too (Jim Thorpe Olympics Fandom, 2024).
                </p>
            <h3>Olympics</h3>
                <p>
                    Thorpe would represent USA during the 1912 Olympics where two new multi-event disciplines were included, the penthathlon and decathlon. Thorpe would compete and win three events in the pentathlon. Thorpe also competed in other disciplines, he competed in the long jump and the high jump where Thorpe would win one Gold Medal. Thorpe's final event was the decathlon in which he dominated and subsequently capping his Olympic run winning 8 of the 15 individual events (Jim Thorpe Olympics Fandom, 2024).

            <h3>Olympic Medals Stripped</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1912, the Olympics had strict rules regarding professionally paid players participating. Competitors who received compensation, sports teachers as well as those who had competed against professionals were prohibited from competing in the Olympics. Word had circulated in the newspapers that Thorpe has competed professionally and was compensated in doing so. This made waves towards the Amateur Athletic Union where consideration of stripping Jim Thorpe of his medals was discussed. Although the public did not care much of this controversy, James Edward Sullivan, a secretary of the Amateur Athletic Union took the controversy very seriously and so the Union would strip Thorpe of his Olympic titles, medals  and awards while also declaring him a professional. Fortunately, Jim Thorpe would have his achievements in the olympic reinstated but this would happen only in recent decades, long after his passing (Wikimedia Foundation, 2024).
                </p>
            <h3>Victim of Racism</h3>
                <p>
                    Jim Thorpe is born to parents who were of mixed-race and was also raised as a Native American. During this period, the US was going through a racial inequality controversy. Often rumours of his olympic achievements being minimised and/or stripped of because of his ethnicity. During his achievements, not all Native Americans were recognized as U.S. citizens, not until 1924. This period also emphasised an individual's ethnicity where headlines, schools and journalists often portrayed sporting competitions as a conflict between the Indians and the Whites. Thorpe was often identified in the News as "Indian Thorpe". This would be the description of his sports identity throughout his life (Wikimedia Foundation, 2024).
